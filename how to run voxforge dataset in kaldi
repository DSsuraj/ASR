NOTE: You will want to download the data set first, before executing this script.
       This can be done for example by:
       
       1. Setting the variable DATA_ROOT in path.sh to point to a
          directory with enough free space (at least 21GB currently (2019))
          
       2. VoxForge data will be stored in:
          e.g., export DATA_ROOT="$KALDI_ROOT/egs/voxforge/s5/voxforge"
         You need to set \"DATA_ROOT\" variable in path.sh to point to the directory to host VoxForge's data
       
       3. Running "./getdata.sh"
       
       3. Running "./run.sh"
